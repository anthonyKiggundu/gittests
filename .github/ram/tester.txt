The goat jumped off the hill because the bees were...
But the lion was patiently waiting under the mango tree

Then came a bat - what? did you say the bat  that causes corona?

As the monkey was watching from abov

The hyena too was waiting anxiously

So the elephant asked the giraffe

The elephant asked the giraffe to pull all tree branches down so that the monkey would be punished

But he giraffe and the monkey had a long standing agreement to always watch one another's back

But the wathog had earlier eavesdropped on the elephant and the hyena so the she has informed her best friends crocodile 
her husband Hippo about the plot.

And the interesting bit is the birds were watching and the pigs were busy eating


The chicken had always waited for their chance to see something that would destroy the bullies in the jungle.

And of course the ducks had a good working relationship with the chicken, although they always never trusted the eagle and kites.

The hippos said they owned the water and had to levy the crocodiles for that

Well the crocodiles thought this as a threat to their existence and decided to talk to fish


Coming through to you Mr. Leopard and the frogs fight with the sneaches

The hare sat under the tree watching how everything was going in disarray.
